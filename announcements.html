        Ladies and gentlemen, what an interesting campaign it was. I would like to wish the best to Mr. Kennedy. He worked and debated hard. I would like to thank everyone that helped and supported me through my campaign, even if you didn't support me I will make sure everyone gets a say in what I do and plan to pass. This is an interesting time in America. We have to unite and come together. God Bless.<br> <span class="bold">- JQA</span>
