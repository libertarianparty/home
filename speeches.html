            ”Hello North Carolina! We need to keep mining coal and use it as an energy source. Let me give a few reasons why. Cheapest source of energy.  It is by far cheaper than nuclear, natural gas, oil.  Hydro usually will be slightly cheaper.  However,  problems with hydro include: no new facilities because of public outcry when river valleys are dammed; and, peak demand time problems (rivers running dry in the dead of summer when peak air conditioning is needed and rivers are frozen in the dead of winter when peak heating is needed).
                <br>
                <br>
            Coal also provides a stable source of energy (no Arab oil embargoes, no sudden scarcity like you experience with natural gas) and there is a very plentiful supply both in the U.S. and in other foreign countries.
            <br>
            <br>
            Coal is nothing more than ancient wood which has been under pressure for millions of years.  It is not sinister as you may have been led to believe.
            <br>
            <br>
            Coal is American made.  We do not have to import this product into this country.
            <br>
            <br>
            Coal can be mined and burned with little environmental impact.  There has been tremendous strides in environmental responsibility with mining coal and burning coal.  However, there still is pressure of global warming.  If we burn less fossil fuels, what, as a practical matter, is our energy alternative?  Nuclear?  Hydro?  Solar (there is no practical way to provide the massive amounts of electricity needed to run our country through solar energy---it is viewed as impractical at this time)?
            <br>
            <br>
            Coal provides 56% of the electricity used in the nation each day.  It provides 95% of Kentucky's electricity.  Electrical rates in Kentucky are the second lowest in the nation---because of coal. This is why you should elect John Quincy Adams!”
